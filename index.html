								<p>I wish I had one of those inspiring stories where I could tell you I was born an engineer, writing code and building products since I was two years old. But the truth is, I was more of a wrecker than a builder. I was so curious about both software and hardware that I would tinker with every little detail on our computer. I barely made anything worthwhile, but the nearby technician was certainly very happy about this.</p>
								
								<p>I wasn’t an engineer as a kid, but I was very good at math. So good that when I became a teenager, everyone told me I should study finance because there was a lot of money in it. This was before computer engineers started getting crazy salaries—at least not in our corner of the world. But I didn’t want to work in finance, and my parents couldn’t afford private education for an engineering degree. The only way was to win a very competitive scholarship. Besides math and physics, I wasn’t particularly a great student. Definitely not good enough to win such a scholarship.</p>
								
								<p>But I knew I didn’t want to be in finance, so I did what every 16-year-old would do at that age: I shaved my head and locked myself in a room with dozens of books.</p>
								
								<p>Long story short, I got into my dream university. It wasn’t what I thought it would be. Everyone just wanted to publish a paper and get a scholarship from an American university. Aside from that, the university was fun, and I learned many programming languages and started working on my own projects.</p>
								
								<p>Two years later, life is great. I love what I do. I come up with an idea, design it in Photoshop, build an Android application, do all the server-side programming myself, and publish the app.</p>
								
								<p>The only problem is that I’m not successful. Although I have dozens of applications on the App Store, I have very little money in my pocket.</p>
								
								<p>It’s so much work for so little reward. I also have a technical blog where I write about the technologies I learn along the way.</p>
								
								<p>One day, I get a call. It’s the CTO of a startup. I don’t know what a CTO is, but I know what a startup is. I’ve always wanted to have one myself.</p>
								
								<p>Their team loves my blog, and he wants to hire me to build the new version of their apps. Their startup is working, but their product isn’t. He thinks I’ll agree to work for them day and night in the basement of a house, doing an impossible job to launch two super complicated products on a tight deadline in exchange for money! He thinks right!</p>
								
								<p>I willingly sell my soul. I would’ve done it for less! But they offer me a good deal. And I do the impossible for them.</p>
								
								<p>I spend many nights in the office working on the product. My mom thinks I’m lying when I say I’m staying in the office. The dark circles under my eyes and constant tiredness make her believe I’m addicted to something. I kind of am. Building a product in a fast-growing startup is so addictive.</p>
								
								<p>We launch, we’re successful, and we grow. Everything is great until it isn’t.</p>
								
								<p>The business is growing, there are a lot of processes for making every decision, and I’m not part of any of them. Some idiots are now telling me how I should build my product. They call themselves product managers! Stupid product managers.</p>
								
								<p>I must destroy them. But I can’t. I need to destroy them from within. I’m going to expose them for the frauds they are.</p>
								
								<p>So I become a product manager!</p>
								
								<p>Nietzsche has a famous quote that says:</p>
								
								<p>
								<blockquote>
								  He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.
								</blockquote>
								</p>
								
								<p>I hadn’t read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12321.Beyond_Good_and_Evil">Beyond Good and Evil</a> back then. I’m now a monster myself!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							    <p>As you might know by now, I quite enjoy selling my soul to companies. I’m not just chasing money; I’m optimizing for learning and the thrill.</p>
							    <p>Just like my LinkedIn profile and resume, this is also a product I’m building to sell my time and skills. But this isn’t going to be a polished list of responsibilities and accomplishments—you can find that on my LinkedIn page. Or email me, and I’ll send you an updated resume.</p>
							    <p>This is for a niche customer segment that’s not optimizing for skills and experience but for character and culture. Those who truly know what it takes to build extraordinary products are extraordinary people.</p>
							    <p>To you, my dear targeted customer segment: despite my reluctance, I can’t tell everything. I must shorten it to increase your engagement and conversion rate! After all, life, just like product management, is nothing but ruthless prioritization!</p>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/journey1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							    <p>Tapsi is a ride-hailing platform similar to Uber. Today, it has 18 million riders and 1.5 million drivers across 15 states, who complete over 1 million rides per day.</p>
							    <p>Tapsi was everything you could wish for as a product manager in your first job. I had to wear many hats in a very short span of time. I worked with a ton of internal and external stakeholders, worked on mobile apps, and launched two 0-to-1 SaaS products. I collaborated with designers, data scientists, infrastructure teams, and worked cross-functionally with marketing, operations, customer experience, legal, safety, HR, and more. I knew everyone by name. It wasn’t easy, but I learned a lot.</p>
							    <p>My first product as a product manager was the last product I developed as an engineer: Tapsi’s driver app. Although, as a PM in a fast-growing startup, my responsibilities weren’t limited to just the driver app. During my time there, I:</p>
							    <ul>
							        <li>Launched the iOS version of the driver app and managed both the Android and iOS teams throughout my tenure. I can’t quantify everything I did, but let me just say that our driver app was a competitive advantage for our business. Many drivers chose us despite our smaller rider base because of how great our driver app was.</li>
							        <li>Launched a SaaS tool for field agents to register drivers faster. This tool reduced driver acquisition time from 45 minutes to less than 15 minutes per driver per agent. I also initiated training an OCR model to automate data entry from driving licenses—my first exposure to machine learning, which was love at first sight.</li>
							        <li>Launched a self-serve SaaS for drivers to self-register. Due to a supply shortage, I had to launch this panel on a very tight deadline. We managed to roll it out in just six weeks—in exchange for a 4K TV and two new games for our PS4!</li>
							        <li>Paying our drivers daily was by far the biggest request from the early days. After rounds of negotiations with different banks and their engineering teams, we essentially invented a new payment system that allowed us to settle with our drivers up to five times a day! For context, Uber and Lyft still pay their drivers weekly.</li>
							    </ul>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/journey2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							    <p>Tapsi was a great experience, but after two and a half years of working day and night, I graduated from it and was ready to challenge myself on a larger scale. I joined Bazaar, the largest digital e-commerce platform in Iran, with over 45 million active users.</p>
							    <p>Bazaar had experienced enormous growth over the past few years and was still expanding into new markets such as audiobooks and video. But with such rapid growth came many challenges.</p>
							    <p>I joined as the discovery product manager—the first touchpoint for users with Bazaar’s product. Bazaar emphasized work-life balance, but I came from hell itself. Very soon, I asked my manager for more responsibility and took charge of two teams: search and discovery. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it because now I was the gatekeeper! I managed the entire funnel that users had to navigate to find any content on the platform.</p>
							    <p>As a product manager with immense power, I:</p>
							    <ul>
							        <li>Led the transition to personalized discovery. Most of the discovery touchpoints were filled with editorial content curated by the content team. The problem was they couldn’t keep up with the ever-changing needs of 45 million users. I worked cross-functionally with data engineers and data scientists (we didn’t have data in discovery back then) to train collaborative and content filtering machine-learning models to personalize various discovery touchpoints.</li>
							        <li>Product teams at Bazaar used microservices, but beneath the surface, they all relied on a class called "core." This class was the stuff of nightmares that seniors warned juniors about to keep them awake at night. I had tons of ideas I wanted to build, but to bring my stakeholders onboard, I needed to run a ton of A/B tests, and this class was a major bottleneck. So, it had to go. We proposed a plan and refactored it in multiple phases.</li>
							        <li>With "core" out of the way, I redesigned discovery and search, one A/B test at a time. We optimized funnels and added new visual components. The new visuals were popular with both demand and supply sides, so we partnered with game studios and publishers to promote them across different parts of the discovery funnel.</li>
							        <li>Partnering with publishers was good business—so good that the content team merged with the discovery product team, and the head of content reported to me to better align the two teams. The only problem was, it wasn’t scalable.</li>
							        <li>I initiated discovery ads—a self-serve DSP-like solution that allowed publishers and game developers to purchase impressions within our discovery experience. All they had to do was set their budget, and our machine-learning model would determine where to promote their app to maximize CTR.</li>
							        <li>By the time I moved on from discovery and search, discovery ads were responsible for 20% of Bazaar’s revenue.</li>
							        <li>Search was more of a technical team. Although I don’t identify as a technical product manager, in search, I dove deep into technical details. My education and experience in software definitely helped me here.</li>
							        <li>The main challenge in search is finding the most relevant results for a user’s query. To do so, we needed to understand the query and map it to our existing database of products based on the data and metadata we had.</li>
							        <li>At its core, our search relied on ElasticSearch, but we enhanced it by integrating TF-IDF vectorization, vector embeddings, and Doc2Vec for descriptions while implementing semantic search strategies.</li>
							        <li>We also built our own user interaction scoring system. These improvements helped decrease our bounce rate from 55% to 36%—a significant improvement.</li>
							    </ul>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/journey3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							    <p>The continuous success of discovery and search, along with managing two teams and training associate product managers, earned me a promotion to Director of Product Management, and I joined the AVOD business vertical.</p>
							    <p>The AVOD vertical was a relatively new business line—similar to Netflix but instead of making money through subscriptions, it generated revenue by showing ads to users.</p>
							    <p>When I joined, the biggest challenge was that watch time wasn’t increasing fast enough. Everyone, including myself, initially assumed I’d do the same things I did in search and discovery—personalize and redesign the funnel to maximize conversion rate and watch time would naturally follow.</p>
							    <p>But I quickly realized that video presented a very different problem. Bazaar had 45 million active users, but only 5 million of those users were video-active.</p>
							    <p>I started by using growth hacking techniques and running a bunch of A/B tests to maximize user awareness and engagement. But as I talked to more customers, I learned the bigger challenge was that we didn’t have what I called content-market fit.</p>
							    <p>You see, Bazaar was primarily a mobile application, but all our content providers were traditional video publishers whose content was mostly movies. Most customers weren’t willing to watch movies on their phones.</p>
							    <p>So we needed to either change our content or our platform. I proposed doing both!</p>
							    <p>I was a director after all and could handle more than one thing at a time! The only problem was that I had to rely on other people to do it. DOING was what I was good at and, for sure, I was missing it.</p>
							    <p>We launched Bazaar Video on TVs, and I negotiated with two major TV manufacturers to have our app pre-installed on their TVs.</p>
							    <p>We also built a proof-of-concept and, when it proved viable, we added short videos to our platform.</p>
							    <p>These were great for watch time! We doubled our watch time from 20 to 40 million minutes, and everyone was happy.</p>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/journey4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							    <p>Well, everyone but me! I wasn’t enjoying being a Director of Product and managing other PMs. I wanted to do what I do best—building products.</p>
							    <p>Our CEO at the time, Mehdi Amiri, was very supportive and agreed to my transition. The company was considering starting new ventures, and I just had the perfect idea!</p>
							    <p>All over the world, creators were monetizing their audiences, but none of these tools worked for Iranian creators. Because of COVID, the creator economy was growing faster than ever, and I believed we could build exactly what the market needed.</p>
							    <p>I made financial projections, wrote a business model canvas, researched markets, and defined the product vision to secure funding and buy-in for my idea.</p>
							    <p>It went pretty smoothly because all I wanted was some money, a senior full-stack developer, and 20% capacity from one of our senior designers.</p>
							    <p>I started talking to customers, building, and iterating, but I wasn’t seeing any strong signals toward product-market fit.</p>
							    <p>We were struggling to find PMF, but then everything changed! Our cool, visionary CEO stepped down, and the new CEO came in with a totally different strategy. He wanted to downsize the business and close all unprofitable verticals.</p>
							    <p>I knew I didn’t want to go back to people management, so I proposed something better.</p>
							    <p>The short videos weren’t profitable yet, but they had significant watch time. The problem was that many of our advertisers didn’t want to advertise in shorts because they considered them low-quality leads. Short video users also tended to skip ads quickly.</p>
							    <p>Working on the creator economy, especially on monetization, I knew most creators made money by producing ad videos for brands and sellers on Instagram. So, I thought, what if we bring that content onto our platform? These videos were optimized for the short attention spans of our users, and suppliers would be more than happy to pay us to show their products to millions of users.</p>
							    <p>Like any other “brilliant” idea, it proved not to be so straightforward. Yes, advertisers wanted more leads, but they weren’t willing to manage yet another platform. They could barely keep up with Instagram and Divar!</p>
							    <p>Yes, Divar! It turned out that almost everyone selling on Instagram was also selling on Divar, the Middle East’s #1 classified ads platform with over 50 million active users and 500,000 listings per day.</p>
							    <p>It was both a threat and an opportunity. If they were already publishing on two platforms and didn’t want a third because it was too much work, all I needed to do was make it effortless to publish on our platform too.</p>
							    <p>Easier said than done, but long story short, I launched a new SaaS that allowed sellers on Instagram and Divar to manage their product listings in one place and publish them on all three platforms.</p>
							    <p>To attract users, I kept discovering more pain points and addressing them in our product. After a year of relentless work, our product helped sellers:</p>
							    <ul>
							        <li>Manage inventory, monitor stock levels, and receive replenishment alerts</li>
							        <li>Improve product listings with suggested titles, typo corrections, and automatic product categorization on Divar</li>
							        <li>Edit listings in bulk</li>
							        <li>Automatically update in-stock and out-of-stock items to avoid overselling</li>
							        <li>Most importantly, create listings in one place and publish them on Instagram, Divar, and Bazaar</li>
							    </ul>
							    <p>I applied all the growth hacks I’d learned from video and PLG strategies from Tapsi and my earlier attempts in the creator economy. We managed to get 50,000 monthly active users in just one year, with over 30,000 new listings per day.</p>
							    <p>It was a huge success for us, but it wasn’t enough to keep the video business line alive. Bazaar was facing monopoly accusations. While it wasn’t anything we couldn’t fight, the decision was made to shut down the video platform as it aligned with the downsizing strategy.</p>
							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/journey5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							    <p>Divar, a sister company to Bazaar, became the natural next step. Hezardastan, the holding company that owns both, is like Meta, with Bazaar as Facebook and Divar as Instagram.</p>
							    <p>I was already close with some product managers and the CEO of Divar since we were the biggest client of their APIs. After the changes at Bazaar, it made sense for my team to join Divar. They acquired my product from Bazaar, and after nearly four years, I moved over to Divar.</p>
							    <p>Divar and Bazaar may seem similar from a distance, but they’re completely different. Bazaar might be a big shark, but Divar is a blue whale. With over 120 categories and 500,000 listings per day, it’s the largest classified ads platform in the Middle East—three times bigger than Kijiji. At Divar, I:</p>
							    <ul>
							        <li>Developed a product strategy to simplify "matching" (what they called their search and discovery)</li>
							        <li>Led the team in forming hypotheses, running A/B tests, and iterating to redesign the discovery funnel</li>
							        <li>Built dashboards in Metabase to align stakeholders and monitor and report results</li>
							    </ul>
							    <p>Half of my time at Divar went into integrating our SaaS product with their existing panel, and the other half was spent increasing the click-through rate of the matching funnel by 25%.</p>
							    <p>My time at Divar was just slightly more than a year because my wife and I were preparing to start a new chapter in our lives—we migrated to Canada!</p>
